# README

Cryptocurrency portfolio tracking app built with Ruby on Rails 6, [Coin Market Cap API](https://coinmarketcap.com/api/) and deployed to [Heroku](https://floating-eyrie-80510.herokuapp.com/) (please allow a minute for the free-tier instance to spin up).

This is a tutorial project with a few enhancements / modifications of my own built for the purpose of refreshing and updating my RoR skills/knowledge.

Enjoy!
